            <h3 class="about">Details About Jerry's Personality</h3>

            <p class="details">Jerry is usually described as an excited, carefree and cheeky mouse, he in several
                episodes is shown to
                be
                cold as he seeks to have fun no matter who he harms, which to Tom's anger his sense of fun is sadistic,
                but
                he also has other targets although Tom is the main one among them, but this last characteristic seems to
                have a limit as in the episode "The Lonesome Mouse" he regrets having set up Tom to be kicked out of the
                house. Also Jerry gets Tom in trouble by the humans, who sometimes doesn’t see Jerry because he’s small.

                <h2>Tom Cat</h2>
                <p class="details font-size">In a number of episodes, Jerry gains an advantage against Tom the Cat. Tom
                    can also
                    overcome Jerry at
                    times, but Jerry nearly always gets his vengeance on Tom. However, in other situations, Tom wins the
                    episode while Jerry loses, implying that Jerry is vulnerable to Tom.</p>

                <h2>The Three Kittens</h2>
                <p class="details font-size">Jerry gets overwhelmed by the three kittens in the episode "Triplet
                    Trouble." Those
                    three are far
                    more
                    effective at keeping Jerry at bay than Tom, but in the end, Tom and Jerry join forces to put a stop
                    to
                    the triplets' antics.</p>
